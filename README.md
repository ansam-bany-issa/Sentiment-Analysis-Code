# Sentiment-Analysis-Code
#Hello friends This is my first project in this site, so I hope you to like it.
Before you start coding, you need to install two libraries (Tweepy and snscrape) then you can go ahead but if you do not want to collect the data; use my dataset!
You have to extract them from the zip file and apply the pre-processing code on both of them, after the preprocessing,
make sentiment analysis by using Roberta AND compare between the result both of datasets.
